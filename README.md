## Introduction

- This project explores the relationship between various movie attributes and their outcomes in terms of revenue, popularity, and user ratings. By leveraging a comprehensive movie dataset, we aim to uncover valuable insights that can inform future movie production and marketing strategies.


## Hypotheses and their Visualisation

    - Check if there is an optimal movie runtime that correlates with higher popularity and revenue

    *Small insight about the running time (in minutes) of the films in the database (min, max and avg)*




- **Revenue Difference Between Action and War Genres**
    - Since those 2 filmes genres have sometimes similar stories they might have the same revenue or similar
